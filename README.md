# R for Data Science
This repository contains all the links to the slides, Google colab notebooks and other resources used in the R for Data Science course taught in collaboration with Turing Students Rotterdam from October 2019 until November 2019. This entry-level R course teaches students, with or without prior programming experience, the fundamentals of the R programming language and the required knowledge to get started in data science. Topics include data types, functions, algorithms, data visualisation and machine learning.  Problem sets are designed to prepare EUR students for applying R in their domains of interest. After this course students should have basic understanding of programming and be ready to dive into the world of data science.

## Course Setup and Rules
The course consists of two parts. The first four weeks are dedicated to diving into the R programming language and a number of core data analytics methods. The last two weeks are dedicated for a data science challenge inspired by real-world problems in collaboration with [Cognizant](https://www.cognizant.com/nl-nl/).

### Practical Information
There are lectures on **Tuesdays** and **Thursdays** from **18.00** until **20.00**. The Google calendar with the schedule of the course is available [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r/month/2019/11/1?cid=dHNvY2lldHkuaW9fNWo4dTlqdGYxbzFpZG9yanZtZzVyb29mMm9AZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ). 80% attendance is mandatory and please inform us *before* class when you are not attending a lecture through a private message on Slack. In case you do not meet the attendance requirement, you are not eligable for the course certificate.

### Teaching Philosphy
At Turing Society, we believe in the power of diversity. People are unique and the best results are obtained by combining different insights and approaches. Therefore, all our courses are open to everyone; it does not matter whether you are a bachelor student, master student, working professional or in a transition period.

Furthermore, we believe learning is most effective when you *learn together*. The focus should be on *learning by doing*, *learning by explaining concepts and solutions to your fellow students* and *learning by means of discussion*. You will see that the journey becomes a lot more enjoyable when you go through it together! In fact, all our staff is helping on voluntary basis because we love learning with you guys.

Please interrupt the course at any moment when you have questions, suggestions or feedback. We are always looking to improve our courses and need you help with this. If you prefer providing your input over other channels, feel free to do this as well. It does not matter who at Turing Students Rotterdam you approach, we all want to hear your ideas and hope to use these to improve the quality of our courses and events.

### Rules
Next to the attendance requirements, we have to set some rules in order to efficiently facilitate learning. There are homework assignments that have to be completed to a sufficient standard to pass the course. If you ever have questions, feel free to reach out to your fellow students or to us over Slack. Note that homework *may* be done in collaboration (in fact, we highly encourage it). However, copying homework is *strictly forbidden*. The goal of this course is for you to improve your coding skills. Copying material from other students is a waste of both your time and our time. Please hand in assignments later and ask questions when you get stuck. We are here to help you.
